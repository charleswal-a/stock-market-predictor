## Introduction

Welcome to my Stock Market Predictor repository! :wave:

This project was my first experience using the Jupyter Lab software. I used Pandas and Scikit-learn to train and evaluated a machine learning model that would predict whether the S&P 500 would go up or not. 

I completed this project using the guidance of a tutorial created by Dataquest on Youtube. Their channel and video are linked in the acknowledgments section.

## Process

Here are steps of the process I went through to create the AI model:

* Downloaded S&P 500 stock data
* Cleaned and visualized stock data
* Set up target of AI model
* Trained initial stock predictor model
* Evaluated model error and created backtesting method
* Improved the model with new predictor columns

## Setup

Here is how to launch this project on your own device:

1. Open stock_market_predictor.ipynb in this Github repo
2. Click the "Raw" button
3. Save the raw text with the .ipynb file extension
4. Run Jupyter Lab and select the file to open

## Contributors

All model training and evaluation was done my me.
