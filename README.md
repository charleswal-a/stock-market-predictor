## Introduction

Welcome to my Stock Market Predictor repository! :wave:

This project is my first experience using the Jupyter Lab software. 

## Process

Here are steps of the process I went through to create the AI model:

* Downloaded S&P 500 stock data
* Cleaned and visualized stock data
* Set up target of AI model
* Trained initial stock predictor model
* Evaluated model error and created backtesting method
* Improved the model with new predictor columns
